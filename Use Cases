1. Scale up Openshift cluster running over VMware using a CF Service Catalog: 
    - User input all required data (like IP, DNS, etc.) in CF;
    - CF provision new VM in VMware using a template and data from CF;
    - Add new server in ansible inventory in bastion server and run scale up playbook.

2. Scale up Openshift cluster running over VMware using a CF Service Catalog + Ansible Tower:
    - Same as before but every step performed by Ansible Tower using Tower inventory (not bastion).
    - Scale up Openshift cluster running over VMware using a CF Service Catalog + Ansible Tower with Infoblox integration:

3. Same as before however fully automated, which means that the provisioning flow will be:
    - Get next available IP from Infoblox;
    - Register new server in Infoblox DNS (A record);
    - Provision new server in VMware;
    - Add new server in Tower inventory and run scale up cluster.
